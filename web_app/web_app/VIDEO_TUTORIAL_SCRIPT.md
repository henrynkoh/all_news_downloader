**[Show search interface]**

Let's start with the basic search functionality. I'll use "artificial intelligence" as our search term.

1. In the left sidebar, enter "artificial intelligence" in the search box.

2. Under "Select Sources", choose which content sources to include. For this demo, I'll select:
   - Naver News
   - Google Search
   - Medium
   
   You can select as many sources as you need.

3. Under "Advanced Options", you can adjust:
   - Number of Pages: This determines how many pages of results to fetch from each source. I'll set this to 3.
   - Results Limit: The maximum number of results to display. I'll keep the default of 50.

4. Now click the "Search" button to start searching.

**[Show progress bar and waiting]**

As you can see, the application is now searching across all selected sources. The progress bar shows you how far along the search is.

**[Show search results]**

And here are our search results! You can see all the articles related to artificial intelligence from our selected sources. Each result includes the title, content snippet, source, and a clickable link.

Notice that the links are clickable – if I click one, it opens in a new tab. This makes it easy to explore the content you've found.

On the right side, you can see a breakdown of which sources your results came from.

## Downloading Results (3:30 - 4:15)

**[Show download button and file]**

After completing a search, you might want to save your results for later analysis. The application automatically saves an Excel file to the downloads folder, but you can also use the "Download Excel File" button to save it to a specific location.

Let me click this button now... and you can see I can choose where to save the file.

If for some reason Excel format doesn't work, the application will automatically try to save as CSV instead.

## Visualizing Results (4:15 - 5:45)

**[Show clicking "Visualize These Results" button]**

One of the most powerful features is the ability to visualize your search results. I'll click the "Visualize These Results" button.

**[Show visualization page]**

This takes us to the Visualization page, which offers several ways to analyze your data:

1. Source Distribution: This pie chart shows what percentage of your results came from each source.

2. Word Cloud: This visual representation shows the most common words in your results, with more frequent words appearing larger.

3. Content Analysis: Here you can see a frequency analysis of key terms in your results.

4. Time Analysis: If your results include publication dates, this timeline shows when the content was published.

You can use the controls on the left to customize these visualizations. For example, I can adjust the number of words in the word cloud or filter the content analysis by specific terms.

## Creating Social Media Ads (5:45 - 7:30)

**[Navigate to the Create Ads tab]**

Now let's look at how you can create social media advertisements based on your research. I'll click on the "Create Ads" tab.

**[Show ad creation interface]**

Here, you can create ads for multiple social media platforms simultaneously. Let me walk you through the process:

1. First, select which platforms you want to create ads for. I'll select Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

2. Next, enter your ad content:
   - Ad Title: "Latest in AI Technology"
   - Ad Description: "Discover the newest advancements in artificial intelligence that are changing the world."
   - Target URL: I'll enter a sample URL

3. I can upload an image for my ad by clicking "Upload Image".
   **[Show uploading an image]**

4. Now I'll configure targeting options:
   - Age Range: 25-45

   - Location: I'll enter "New York"

5. I'll set my budget and schedule:
   - Budget: $50
   - Start Date: I'll choose next Monday
   - Campaign Duration: 7 days

6. Each platform has specific settings I can adjust in these tabs. For example, on Facebook I can select the campaign objective and ad placement.

7. When everything is set, I'll click "Create Ad".

**[Show ad creation results]**

Great! The ads have been created successfully. In a real-world scenario, these would be submitted to the respective platforms' advertising systems.

## Mobile Usage (7:30 - 8:15)

**[Show mobile interface]**

The application is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices. If I access it on a phone or tablet, the interface adapts automatically:

- The navigation changes to a dropdown menu
- Buttons and form elements are larger for easier touch interaction
- Tables scroll horizontally when they're too wide for the screen
- The app automatically shows fewer results to optimize performance

The workflow is the same as on desktop – enter your keywords, select sources, and search.

## Customizing Settings (8:15 - 9:00)

**[Navigate to Settings tab]**

Finally, let's look at how you can customize the application. I'll click on the "Settings" tab.

Here you can adjust:

1. Display Settings:
   - Table Height: Adjust how much of the screen the results table occupies
   - Theme: Switch between dark and light modes
   - Font Size: Make text larger or smaller

2. Search Settings:
   - Default Pages: How many pages to search by default
   - Maximum Pages: Upper limit for searches
   - Request Delay: Time between requests to prevent rate limiting
